# LAUSD Video Pitch Script v1.2

## Target: 90-second pitch
## Changes from v1.1: Shorter PowerSchool punch, v1.0 pacing restored, 1.5X speedup

---

### Scene 1: PowerSchool Punch [0:00-0:08]

**Goal**: Gut-punch, no details, just the devastation

**Script**:
> "December 2024. PowerSchool breached. 62 million student records stolen. The largest K-12 data breach in history. This is what happens when districts lose control of their data."

---

### Scene 2: Problem [0:08-0:20]

**Goal**: v1.0 style - crisp, punchy

**Script**:
> "Right now, your privacy team is drowning. 71-question applications. Weeks of manual review per vendor. Meanwhile, vendors pay Clever 16 to 19 dollars per school per month, and pass those costs back to you."

---

### Scene 3: Solution [0:20-0:35]

**Goal**: PoDS-Lite + tokenization

**Script**:
> "SchoolDay flips the model. Vendors complete a 13-question application and get approved in minutes. How? Tokenization. 80 percent of vendors never touch actual student data. They get secure tokens. Zero privacy risk."

---

### Scene 4: Integration [0:35-0:52]

**Goal**: Show breadth - all integration types

**Script**:
> "One platform. Every integration type. Single sign-on. Rostering with OneRoster and Ed-Fi. LTI 1.3 for deep content linking. And tokenized messaging, so vendors can reach students and parents without ever seeing real emails or phone numbers."

---

### Scene 5: Benefits [0:52-1:05]

**Goal**: 3 clear benefits for LAUSD

**Script**:
> "For L-A-U-S-D's half million students, this means 80 percent fewer manual reviews. Automatic compliance logging for FERPA and COPPA. And SchoolDay is your platform. No Clever fees. No middleman."

---

### Scene 6: Leverage [1:05-1:18]

**Goal**: Vendor value = district leverage

**Script**:
> "Vendors using SchoolDay save thousands in integration fees. They eliminate privacy liability. They get instant access. You're giving them massive value. That means leverage. Demand significant discounts."

---

### Scene 7: Close [1:18-1:30]

**Goal**: Tagline + logo (from website)

**Script**:
> "SchoolDay. Your students. Your data. Your control."
