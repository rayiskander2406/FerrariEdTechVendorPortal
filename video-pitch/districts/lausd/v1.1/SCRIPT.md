### Scene 1: Hook - PowerSchool Breach [0:00-0:15]

**Visual**: Red alert colors, breach graphics, PowerSchool logo crossed out

**Phonetic Script**:
> "December 2024. Power School, the nation's largest student information system, is breached. 62 million student records stolen. Social Security numbers. Medical records. Grades going back to 1985. The root cause? No multi-factor authentication. This is what happens when districts surrender control of their students' data."

---

### Scene 2: Data Sovereignty Problem [0:15-0:28]

**Visual**: Data flowing OUT of schools to third parties

**Phonetic Script**:
> "Every day, L. A. U. S. D. shares student data with hundreds of Ed Tek vendors. Each integration is a potential breach point. Each vendor is a data custodian you didn't choose. Your 516,000 students deserve better. Their families trust you with their most sensitive information. Data sovereignty isn't optional. It's a responsibility."

---

### Scene 3: The SchoolDay Solution [0:28-0:42]

**Visual**: Shield/protection imagery, tokens replacing PII

**Phonetic Script**:
> "SchoolDay restores your data sovereignty. Through tokenization, 80 percent of vendors never touch real student P. I. I. They get secure tokens. Not names. Not emails. Not Social Security numbers. Tokens. Your data stays in your control. Vendors get what they need to function. Nothing more."

---

### Scene 4: How It Works [0:42-0:55]

**Visual**: Token flow diagram, integration icons

**Phonetic Script**:
> "One platform. Every integration type. S. S. O. Rostering. L. T. I. 1.3. And tokenized communication, so vendors can message students without ever seeing real contact information. Vendors complete a 13-question application and get approved in minutes. No 71-question reviews. No weeks of waiting. Just secure, sovereign access."

---

### Scene 5: Your Leverage [0:55-1:08]

**Visual**: Balance scale, negotiation imagery

**Phonetic Script**:
> "Vendors using SchoolDay save thousands in integration fees. They eliminate privacy liability. They get instant access. You're giving them massive value while protecting your students. That's leverage. Demand significant discounts in exchange for secure, streamlined access through your sovereign platform."

---

### Scene 6: Close - Data Sovereignty Tagline [1:08-1:20]

**Visual**: SchoolDay logo (from schoolday.com) with tagline

**Phonetic Script**:
> "L. A. U. S. D. students and families have a right to privacy. You have the power to protect it. SchoolDay makes data sovereignty possible. Your students. Your data. Your control."
