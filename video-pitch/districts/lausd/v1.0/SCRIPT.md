## SCRIPT (Read at moderate pace)

### [0:00-0:10] HOOK - The Numbers That Matter

**NARRATOR:**
"670,000 students. 1,000 schools. Hundreds of EdTech vendors requesting access to student data every year. Each one takes weeks to review. That's about to change."

---

### [0:10-0:25] THE PROBLEM - Current Pain

**NARRATOR:**
"Right now, your privacy team is drowning. 71-question applications. Weeks of manual review per vendor. Meanwhile, vendors are paying Clever $16 to $19 per school per month just to connect—and passing those costs back to you. It's slow, expensive, and risky."

---

### [0:25-0:45] THE SOLUTION - SchoolDay

**NARRATOR:**
"SchoolDay's Vendor Portal flips the model. Vendors complete a 13-question PoDS-Lite application and get approved in *minutes*—not weeks. How? Tokenization. 80% of vendors never need to touch actual student PII. They get tokens like TKN_STU_8X9Y2Z that work perfectly for personalization, progress tracking, and analytics—with zero privacy risk."

---

### [0:45-1:05] LAUSD BENEFITS - Triple Win

**NARRATOR:**
"For LAUSD, this means three things:

**One**: Your privacy team handles 80% fewer manual reviews.

**Two**: Every data access is automatically logged and auditable—FERPA, COPPA, and California Ed Code compliance built in.

**Three**: SchoolDay is *your* platform. No Clever fees. No middleman."

---

### [1:05-1:20] VENDOR BENEFITS - The Leverage

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's where it gets strategic. Vendors using SchoolDay save thousands in integration fees and eliminate their privacy liability entirely. They get instant access instead of waiting weeks. You're giving them massive value—and that means leverage."

---

### [1:20-1:30] THE ASK - Close

**NARRATOR:**
"Demand significant discounts from vendors in exchange for this streamlined, secure access. SchoolDay makes it possible. Let's talk."
